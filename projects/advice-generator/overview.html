    <h2>Project purpose and goal</h2>
    <p>I chose this exercise in order to practice my Javascript, and to use an API. I was not familiar with Fetch and how to manipulate the data that you receive from it. I feel way more comfortable now.</p>

    <h2>Web Stack and explanation</h2>
    <p>The stack is basic since the design and functionnalities don't require a lot of sophistication. This kind of project is good to learn how to go to the essential and not overuse technologies, or assets that are not really needed. "Don't kill a fly with a bazooka."</p>

    <h2>Problem and thought process</h2>
    <p>I understood pretty early that I would not need to call the API many times, or to use an array to store the data or anything elaborate. The goal is simple, get an advice from the API and the ID that comes with it, display them at the right place, and create a function for the dice button that will call another advice. <br>
    The trick for me, since it was the actual first time I used an API, was to simplify the code I had written, because it called the API with the fetch function everytime it was needed, instead of creating a fetch function that would be called  when needed. I drastically reduced the size of my script, and made it a bit more elegant.</p>

    <h2>Lesson learned</h2>
    <p>A first step with APIs that went very well, refactoring the code again and again is a good training and the exercise made me more confident about my skills overall.</p>
