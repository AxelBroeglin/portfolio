        <h2 class="project__h2">Project purpose and goal</h2>
        <p class="project__p">I chose this exercise in order to <strong>practice my Javascript, and to use an API</strong>. I was not familiar with Fetch and how to manipulate the data that you receive from it. I feel way more comfortable now.</p>

        <h2 class="project__h2">Web Stack choice</h2>
        <p class="project__p">The stack is basic since the design and functionnalities don't require a lot of sophistication. This kind of project is good to learn how to <strong>go to the essential and not overuse technologies</strong>, or assets that are not really needed. "Don't kill a fly with a bazooka."</p>

        <h2 class="project__h2">Thought process</h2>
        <p class="project__p">I understood pretty early that I would not need to call the API many times, or to use an array to store the data or anything elaborate. <strong>The goal is simple</strong>, get an advice from the API and the ID that comes with it, display them at the right place, and create a function for the dice button that will call another advice. <br>
        The trick for me, since it was the actual first time I used an API, was to simplify the code I had written, because it called the API with the fetch function everytime it was needed, instead of creating a fetch function that would be called  when needed. <strong>I drastically reduced the size of my script, and made it a bit more elegant</strong>.</p>

        <h2 class="project__h2">Lesson learned</h2>
        <p class="project__p">A first step with APIs that went very well, refactoring the code again and again is a good training and <strong>the exercise made me more confident about my skills overall</strong>.</p>
