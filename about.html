        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>I obtained my diploma as a <a href="https://buroscope.bzh/fpdf/fiche_produit.php?id_dossier=19&id_document=151">Technical Integrator</a> (online PDF, in French) in 2016, I then started working as a self employed developer and web marketing consultant. I helped several companies and individuals to create their websites, and I developed web marketing strategies (SEO, SEA) for several clients.</p>
        <p>With several friends, I launched the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.scan_eat">Scan Eat app</a> in 2017, I worked as a project manager for two years. The app now has over 500,000 downloads, only thanks to word of mouth, we are proud of it! </p>
        <p>I then worked as a marketing expert for Facebook, while continuing to build several websites and run several SEA campaigns (particularly using Adwords) for different customers.</p>

        <h2>As a developper</h2>
        <p>Being partly self-taught, I think I can say that I am resourceful, determined and passionate. I believe that a developer cannot stop learning at any point in his career, and that's good, because I am always looking for the next thing to discover.</p>

        <h2>As a colleague</h2>
        <p>I am a team player, I believe in collective intelligence, the ability of a group to overcome obstacles.
            Having said that, I also believe in the capacity of each individual to surpass themselves and to learn from their own mistakes.</p>

        <h2>As a person</h2>
        <p>I have had many jobs in my life, in many different fields and I have learned a lot from them. I know the value of hard work, dedication and commitment.
            As mentioned earlier, I am naturally very curious, I love to learn new things. My hobbies are diverse, ranging from video games (mostly indie), to reading, movies (mostly from Asia) and the NBA.
            I often listen to music while coding.</p>
