        <h1 class="about__h1">About me</h1>

        <p>I obtained my diploma as a <a href="https://buroscope.bzh/fpdf/fiche_produit.php?id_dossier=19&id_document=151">Technical Integrator</a> from Buroscope (Rennes, France) in 2016, I then started working as a <span class="span-bold">self employed developer</span> and web marketing consultant. This includes <span class="span-bold">designing and coding</span>, and <span class="span-bold">SEO and SEA strategies</span>.</p>
        <div class="about__scan-eat">
            <p class="about__scan-eat__p">With several friends, I launched the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.scan_eat">Scan Eat app</a> in 2017, for which I was <span class="span-bold">Project Manager for two years</span>. The app now has over 500,000 downloads. <br>
            I then worked as a <span class="span-bold">marketing expert for Facebook.</span> My job was to help a portfolio of customers optimizing their campaigns on the platform. While holding these positions, I continued my freelancing activities.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="button-container about__scan-eat__button-container">
            <a href="about.html">
                <button class="about__scan-eat__first-button button-green">Download my resume</button>
            </a>

        <h2>As a developper</h2>
        <p>Being partly self-taught, I think I can say that <span class="span-bold">I am resourceful, determined and passionate.</span> I believe that a developer cannot stop learning at any point in his career, and that's good, because I am always looking for the next thing to discover.</p>


        <h2>As a colleague</h2>
        <p>I am a team player, I believe in <span class="span-bold">collective intelligence</span>, the ability of a group to overcome obstacles.
            Having said that, I also believe in the capacity of each individual to surpass themselves and to learn from their own mistakes.</p>


        <h2>As a person</h2>
        <p>I have had many jobs in my life, in many different fields and I have learned a lot from them. I know the value of <span class="span-bold">hard work, dedication and commitment</span>.
            As mentioned earlier, I am naturally very curious, I love to learn new things. My hobbies are diverse, ranging from video games (mostly indie), to reading, movies to the NBA.
            I often listen to music while coding.</p>
